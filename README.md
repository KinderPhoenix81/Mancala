# Mancala Application
This app was not solely developed by me, but by a group of students I worked with to create this project in just 6 to 7 weeks. Development took place in Visual Studio 2022, and is developed fully using C#.

If you don't know how to play Mancala, there are rules in the application, or plenty online to read; it's pretty simple at first, but can involve lots of strategy later

## Features
- 2 player mode
  - Human or AI players
  - AI players have a simple (random input) difficulty, and a complex difficulty
- Variable pit amounts
- Variable stones per pit
- Cyclone mode (explained below)
- Golden stone mode (explained below)
- Colored stones & movement animations

### Cyclone Mode
As part of this project, we had to develop two additional game modes, this being the first one. In typical gameplay, landing in your store would allow you to go again, but with this mode enabled, you also *reverse the direction of play*. You still skip over the opponents store, but now you place stones in the opposite direction. To reverse the effect, a player must land in their store with their last stone during their turn. This switching of directions continues until the game is over.

### Golden Stone Mode
While all of the stones are fairly colorful, one of them stands out from the rest. This golden stone will randomly appear in any pit, and will award the user more points than usual, and can be chosen where it can land during your turn.
